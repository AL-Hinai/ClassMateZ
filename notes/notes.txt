this is a file so that git notices the notes folder but in here we can add all the notes we have on our progress and issues


A guide to serup your git repo from scratch

>first go to the main master repo at https://github.com/aquaktus/ClassMateZ
>then fork the repository to your git account (button at the top right)
>then downdoad the repo into your pythonAnywhere server

>then go to the base directory of the repo
>run these commands:

git remote add upstream https://github.com/aquaktus/ClassMateZ.git
git fetch upstream

>this sets the main repo (the one on my account) to be a remote one called upstream
>yow are now connected

>you have to then copy the wsgi.py file that is in the notes folder to the app folder ClassMateZ/ClassMateZ/
>and change line 21 to the name of your user on pythonAnywhere
>you have to do this step!!! if not it won't work!!!

>this command below is essential!!!!!!!!!!!
git pull upstream master

>this is to pull all the newest changes from the main master branch, do it every time you start working on the app since you have to be up to date with the master branch to push and not have merge conflicts with others

================================

>to add changes you have made to your branch/fork to the main master
>push all changes to your master repo (as you would normaly)
>then use the GUI on the git hub website to make a pull request to the master branch on aquaktus's account
>submit it
>and if you have the correct permissions
>you can merge them yourself
>if not, send me a message to merge them for you

>that's it! have fun!
